# ðŸ§  Empathetic AI in VR Therapy (WIP)

> **Investigating the Role of Context Retention on Perceived Empathy in VR-Based AI Conversational Agents**

## Overview

This project explores how **context memory** in AI conversational agents (CAs) influences **usersâ€™ perceived empathy**â€”a key factor in therapeutic alliance. 

Focusing on VR-based therapy for mental health, the project compares two AI agents:
- One with **only in-session memory**
- One with **persistent, cross-session memory**

The goal is to identify how memory-enhanced dialogue can improve the **emotional connection** and **engagement** in VR therapy, especially for young adults.
